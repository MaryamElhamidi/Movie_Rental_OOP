## 🎬 Movie Rental Store – Python OOP Project

### 📌 Overview

This project simulates a basic movie rental store using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python. It allows users to:

* Rent movies
* Return movies
* Calculate late fees
* Interact with a basic text-based menu

The project is structured around two main classes:

* `MovieStore`: Handles the core functionality (renting, returning, late fees)
* `MovieRentalApp` and `Bonus`: Simulate user interaction and input/output flow

### 💡 Features

* Encapsulation via private and getter/setter methods
* Includes bonus menu for enhanced UX
